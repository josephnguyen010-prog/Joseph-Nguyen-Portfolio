/**
 * Background music and per-sign activation sounds.
 *
 * Files are discovered by name, the same way portraits are:
 *
 *   assets/audio/theme.mp3          looped background music
 *   assets/audio/<sign>.mp3         played once when that sign fires
 *
 * Anything missing is simply skipped, so a folder with only a theme in it works
 * fine, as does no folder at all.
 *
 * Browsers refuse to start audio without a user gesture, so nothing here plays
 * until start() is called -- which happens from the Start button's click
 * handler. Calling it any other way gets the play promise rejected and no sound.
